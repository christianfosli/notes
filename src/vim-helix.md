## Vim favorite commands / built in stuff

* CTRL-] or gd - Jump to definition

* CTRL-O Jump back

* CTRL-I Jump forward

* K show definition of keyword

* f {char} - go to first occurance of char

* t {char} - go just before first occurance of char

## Helix (move me somewhere?)

* Due to some intelligent(ish) workspace root detection looking for .git folder,
  make sure to open deno files from the correct folder.
