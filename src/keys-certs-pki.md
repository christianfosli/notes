## Fun facts

PEM stands for Privacy Enhanced Email. It was originally developed to encrypt emails.
It never cought on, though, and the related RFC's were eventually obsoleted by PGP and S/MIME.

## Step CLI

## ssh-rsa

* [Deprecated by OpenSSL](https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-announce/2020-February/000138.html)
  > It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
  > SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K. For this reason, we will be
  > disabling the "ssh-rsa" public key signature algorithm by default in a

* Solution: Switch SSH keys to Eliptic Curve ed25519

  * Problem: [Azure DevOps only supports legacy ssh-rsa](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/support-non-rsa-keys-for-ssh-authentication/365980)
